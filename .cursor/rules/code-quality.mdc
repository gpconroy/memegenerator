# Code Quality & Organization

## General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid code duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## JavaScript Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions: `getUserData`, `imageUpload`
- Use `PascalCase` for constructors/classes: `MemeGenerator`
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants: `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`
- Use descriptive names: `selectedText` not `st`, `imageUpload` not `img`

### Function Design
- Functions should do one thing well
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into separate functions
- Use function declarations for hoisting, arrow functions for callbacks
- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments

### Code Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns: DOM manipulation, business logic, event handling
- Use modules or namespaces to avoid global namespace pollution
- Declare variables at the top of their scope
- Initialize variables with meaningful default values

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use try-catch for async operations and risky code
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging (console.error in development)
- Validate user input before processing

### Comments
- Write self-documenting code (code should explain itself)
- Add comments for "why", not "what"
- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Remove commented-out code before committing

## HTML Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper meta tags (charset, viewport)
- Use descriptive alt text for images
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Use ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep HTML structure clean and organized

## CSS Best Practices

- Use consistent naming (BEM, OOCSS, or similar methodology)
- Avoid inline styles
- Use CSS variables for repeated values
- Organize styles logically (layout, components, utilities)
- Use mobile-first responsive design
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested (max 3-4 levels)
- Use flexbox/grid for layouts instead of floats

## Code Review Checklist

Before committing code, ensure:
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No console.log statements left in production code
- [ ] Error handling is in place
- [ ] Code is tested and working
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] Functions are appropriately sized
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be constants
