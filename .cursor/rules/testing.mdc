# Testing Best Practices

## General Testing Principles

- Write tests alongside code (Test-Driven Development when appropriate)
- Test critical functionality thoroughly
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Tests should be independent and repeatable
- Maintain tests as code changes

## Types of Testing

### Unit Testing
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths
- Aim for high code coverage on critical paths
- Keep tests fast and focused

### Integration Testing
- Test how components work together
- Test user workflows end-to-end
- Verify data flow between components
- Test API integrations (if applicable)

### Manual Testing
- Test in multiple browsers
- Test on different devices and screen sizes
- Test with keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Test error scenarios

## Testing Checklist

Before considering code complete:
- [ ] All functions work as expected
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty inputs, large files, etc.)
- [ ] Works in target browsers
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Test Scenarios for This Project

### Image Upload
- [ ] Valid image file uploads successfully
- [ ] Invalid file types are rejected
- [ ] Large files are handled appropriately
- [ ] Error message shown on upload failure

### Text Input
- [ ] Text appears on canvas correctly
- [ ] Text wrapping works for long text
- [ ] Multi-line text works (Enter key)
- [ ] Empty text doesn't break the app

### Canvas Operations
- [ ] Text positioning works (click and drag)
- [ ] Text rotation works correctly
- [ ] Color changes apply correctly
- [ ] Font size changes work

### Download
- [ ] Download generates correct image
- [ ] Downloaded image matches canvas preview
- [ ] Download works with all text elements
- [ ] Download filename is appropriate

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Very long text strings
- [ ] Special characters in text
- [ ] Very large images
- [ ] Very small images
- [ ] Rapid user interactions
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons

## Browser Testing

Test in:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (if on Mac)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Testing

- Test with large images (5MB+)
- Test with multiple rapid interactions
- Monitor memory usage
- Check for memory leaks
- Verify smooth animations

## Accessibility Testing

- Test with keyboard only
- Test with screen reader
- Check color contrast
- Verify focus indicators
- Test with browser zoom (200%)
