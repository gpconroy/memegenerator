# Git Version Control Guidelines

## General Principles

- This project uses Git for version control. Always ensure Git is properly initialized before making significant changes.
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain what and why, not just what.

## Commit Message Format

- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be specific: "Fix text positioning bug" not "Fix bug"
- Keep first line under 50 characters when possible
- Add detailed description for complex changes

## Branching Strategy

- Use `master` or `main` for stable, production-ready code
- Create feature branches for new features: `git branch feature/feature-name`
- Create bugfix branches for fixes: `git branch bugfix/issue-description`

## Before Committing

- Check status: `git status`
- Review changes: `git diff`
- Ensure all files are properly staged
- Verify the project still works after changes

## File Management

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Commit related changes together
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change

## Integration with Cursor

- Cursor should respect Git workflow
- When suggesting code changes, consider Git best practices
- Remind user to commit changes regularly
- Help create appropriate commit messages when needed
