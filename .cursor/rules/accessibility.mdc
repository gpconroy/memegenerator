# Accessibility Best Practices

## General Accessibility Principles

- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Provide text alternatives for images and media
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Make forms accessible with proper labels
- Test with screen readers

## Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Use proper focus management
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Ensure logical tab order
- Support keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
- Don't remove default keyboard behaviors

## Screen Reader Support

- Use semantic HTML (nav, main, article, section, etc.)
- Provide descriptive alt text for images
- Use ARIA labels when HTML semantics aren't enough
- Ensure form inputs have associated labels
- Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## Visual Accessibility

- Maintain color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide text alternatives for icons
- Ensure text is resizable (up to 200% without loss of functionality)
- Use clear, readable fonts
- Provide sufficient spacing between interactive elements

## Form Accessibility

- Associate labels with inputs using `for` attribute or wrapping
- Provide clear error messages
- Indicate required fields
- Use appropriate input types (email, tel, number, etc.)
- Group related form fields with fieldset/legend
- Provide helpful placeholder text

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- Use ARIA roles when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- Use aria-label for unlabeled interactive elements
- Use aria-describedby for additional context
- Use aria-live for dynamic content updates
- Use aria-disabled for disabled interactive elements
- Don't overuse ARIA (prefer semantic HTML)

## Focus Management

- Ensure focus is visible (don't remove outline without replacement)
- Manage focus for modal dialogs
- Return focus to trigger element when closing modals
- Skip links for long pages
- Focus management for single-page applications

## Best Practices for This Project

- Add proper labels to all form inputs
- Ensure color picker is keyboard accessible
- Add aria-label to canvas for screen readers
- Provide text alternatives for template images
- Ensure download button is keyboard accessible
- Add focus indicators to all interactive elements
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Provide error messages for file upload failures
- Ensure text inputs are properly labeled
